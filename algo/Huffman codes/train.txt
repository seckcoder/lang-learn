LEBRON JAMES   I M THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD  LEBRON JAMES  THE GREATEST BASKETBALL PLAYER IN THE WORLD  CORRECTLY STATED THAT HE WAS THE GREATEST BASKETBALL PLAYER IN THE WORLD AFTER HIS CLEVELAND CAVALIERS LOST TO THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS IN GAME   OF THE NBA FINALS ON SUNDAY    I FEEL CONFIDENT  DESPITE BEING DOWN     IN THE SERIES  BECAUSE I M THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD   JAMES SAID SUNDAY   IT S THAT SIMPLE    JAMES WAS RESPONDING TO A QUESTION ABOUT THE TEAM   S PLETHORA OF INJURIES AND WHETHER THEY HAVE CHANGED HIS MENTALITY IN THE FINALS   YOU SEEM TO BE PLAYING A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE THIS FINALS SERIES  THERE WAS A PLAY I THINK YOU HAD A BEHIND THE BACK LAYUP WHERE YOU WENT UP  AND YOU ARE MAKING CRAZY THREES  DO YOU FEEL A LOT LESS PRESSURE THIS FINALS RUN JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE UNDERMANNED AND YOU HAD SOME INJURIES AS OPPOSED TO PREVIOUS YEARS  AFTER THE EXCHANGE  LEBRON WAS THEN ASKED     BUT IN REGARDS TO PRESSURE WITH THE GAMES PLAYED  DO YOU FEEL AS IF THIS FINALS TEAM IS A LITTLE LESS           NO  IT S THE FINALS     JAMES SAID     SOMETHING YOU DREAM OF WHEN YOU   RE A KID  AND FOR ME  I PUT THE WORK IN  I PUT THE WORK IN EVERY SINGLE DAY  EITHER WHEN YOU GUYS ARE THERE  OR WHEN YOU GUYS ARE NOT THERE  SOME OF OUR BEAT WRITERS SEE ME  THEY KNOW HOW MUCH WORK I PUT INTO IT       AND I GIVE EVERYTHING TO MY TEAMMATES     HE ADDED     AND YOU RE TRUE TO THE GAME  DOES NOT MATTER IF IT IS A REGULAR SEASON GAME OR A FINALS GAME  YOU JUST GO OUT AND TRUST WHAT YOU PUT INTO THE GAME  AND YOU LIVE WITH THE RESULTS  SO  IT SHOULDN T NOT BE CRAZY WHEN I MAKE THREES  THOUGH  IT IS JUST A SHOT      JAMES HAS AVERAGED      POINTS       REBOUNDS AND     ASSISTS THROUGH THE FIRST FIVE GAMES OF THE NBA FINALS  THERE   S CHATTER HE   S PLAYED SO OVERWHELMINGLY WELL THAT HE SHOULD WIN THE FINALS MVP TROPHY EVEN IF HIS TEAM LOSES  WHICH HAS ONLY HAPPENED ONCE BEFORE   IT   S NOT JUST THE FINALS EITHER  LEBRON AVERAGED  0   POINTS     0 REBOUNDS AND     ASSISTS IN THE CONFERENCE FINALS AGAINST THE ATLANTA HAWKS    STEPHEN CURRY WAS DESERVING OF THE MVP THIS YEAR  BUT AT FULL STRENGTH  THERE   S STILL NO QUESTION ABOUT IT  LEBRON JAMES IS THE BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD   GUY STEELE IS A TRUE PROGRAMMING POLYGLOT  WHEN I ASKED HIM WHAT LANGUAGES HE HAS USED SERIOUSLY HE CAME UP WITH THIS LIST  COBOL  FORTRAN  IBM    0 ASSEMBLY  PDP  0 MACHINE LANGUAGE  APL  C  C    BLISS  GNAL  COMMON LISP  SCHEME  MACLISP  S   LISP   LISP  C   JAVA  JAVASCRIPT  TCL  HASKELL  FOCAL  BASIC  TECO  AND TEX     THOSE WOULD BE THE MAIN ONES  I GUESS     HE ADDED   HE HAD A HAND IN THE CREATION OF BOTH OF THE MAJOR SURVIVING GENERAL PURPOSE LISP DIALECTS  COMMON LISP AND SCHEME  HE SERVED ON THE STANDARDS BODIES THAT DEFINED COMMON LISP  FORTRAN  C  ECMASCRIPT  AND SCHEME AND WAS RECRUITED BY BILL JOY TO HELP WRITE THE OFFICIAL LANGUAGE SPECIFICATION FOR JAVA  HE IS NOW AT WORK DESIGNING FORTRESS  A NEW LANGUAGE FOR HIGH PERFORMANCE SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING   STEELE   S ACADEMIC CAREER INCLUDED AN AB FROM HARVARD AND AN SM AND PHD FROM MIT  WHILE AT MIT HE COLLABORATED WITH GERALD SUSSMAN ON A SERIES OF PAPERS NOW KNOWN AS    THE LAMBDA PAPERS     WHICH INCLUDED THE ORIGINAL DEFINITION OF THE SCHEME PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE  HE HAS ALSO BEEN A CHRONICLER OF HACKER CULTURE AS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL COMPILERS OF THE JARGON FILE AND EDITOR OF THE BOOK VERSION  THE HACKER   S DICTIONARY  SUBSEQUENTLY UPDATED AND EXPANDED BY ERIC S  RAYMOND AS THE NEW HACKER   S DICTIONARY   AND HE PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE BIRTH OF EMACS AND WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PROGRAMMERS TO PORT DONALD KNUTH   S PROGRAM TEX   STEELE IS A FELLOW OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY AND THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES AND A MEMBER OF THE U S  NATIONAL ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING  HE WON THE ACM   S GRACE MURRAY HOPPER AWARD IN      AND DR  DOBB   S EXCELLENCE IN PROGRAMMING AWARD IN  00    IN THIS INTERVIEW HE TALKS ABOUT DESIGNING SOFTWARE AND THE RELATION BETWEEN WRITING AND PROGRAMMING  AND HE GIVES ONE OF THE BEST EXPLANATIONS I   VE EVER HEARD OF THE VALUE   AND LIMITATIONS   OF FORMAL PROOFS OF CORRECTNESS    LISP HACKER  EARLY NETSCAPE DEVELOPER  AND NIGHTCLUB OWNER JAMIE ZAWINSKI  A K A  JWZ  IS A MEMBER OF THE SELECT GROUP OF HACKERS WHO ARE AS WELL KNOWN BY THEIR THREE LETTER INITIALS AS BY THEIR FULL NAMES   ZAWINSKI STARTED WORKING AS A PROGRAMMER AS A TEENAGER WHEN HE WAS HIRED TO HACK LISP AT A CARNEGIE MELLON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LAB  AFTER ATTENDING COLLEGE JUST LONG ENOUGH TO DISCOVER THAT HE HATED IT  HE WORKED IN THE LISP AND AI WORLD FOR NEARLY A DECADE  GETTING A STRANGE IMMERSION IN A FADING HACKER SUBCULTURE WHEN OTHER PROGRAMMERS HIS AGE WERE GROWING UP WITH MICROCOMPUTERS   HE WORKED AT UC BERKELEY FOR PETER NORVIG  WHO HAS DESCRIBED HIM AS    ONE OF THE OF THE BEST PROGRAMMERS I EVER HIRED     AND LATER AT LUCID  THE LISP COMPANY  WHERE HE ENDED UP LEADING THE DEVELOPMENT OF LUCID EMACS  LATER RENAMED XEMACS  WHICH EVENTUALLY LED TO THE GREAT EMACS SCHISM  ONE OF THE MOST FAMOUS OPEN SOURCE FORKS   IN      HE FINALLY LEFT LUCID AND THE LISP WORLD TO JOIN NETSCAPE  THEN A FLEDGLING START UP  WHERE HE WAS ONE OF THE ORIGINAL DEVELOPERS OF THE UNIX VERSION OF THE NETSCAPE BROWSER AND LATER OF THE NETSCAPE MAIL READER   IN      ZAWINSKI WAS ONE OF THE PRIME MOVERS  ALONG WITH BRENDAN EICH  BEHIND MOZILLA ORG  THE ORGANIZATION THAT TOOK THE NETSCAPE BROWSER OPEN SOURCE  A YEAR LATER  DISCOURAGED BY THE LACK OF PROGRESS TOWARD A RELEASE  HE QUIT THE PROJECT AND BOUGHT A SAN FRANCISCO NIGHTCLUB  THE DNA LOUNGE  WHICH HE NOW RUNS  HE IS CURRENTLY DEVOTING HIS ENERGIES TO BATTLING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONVERT THE CLUB TO AN ALL AGES VENUE FOR LIVE MUSIC   IN THIS INTERVIEW WE TALKED ABOUT  AMONG OTHER THINGS  WHY C   IS AN ABOMINATION  THE JOY OF HAVING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE USE YOUR SOFTWARE  AND THE IMPORTANCE OF TINKERING FOR BUDDING PROGRAMMERS    BRAD FITZPATRICK IS THE YOUNGEST PERSON I INTERVIEWED AND THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS NEVER LIVED IN A WORLD WITHOUT THE INTERNET OR PERSONAL COMPUTERS  BORN IN    0  HE GOT AN EARLY START AS A PROGRAMMER  LEARNING TO PROGRAM AT AGE FIVE ON A HOME BUILT APPLE II CLONE  BY HIS TEENAGE YEARS THE INTERNET REVOLUTION WAS IN FULL SWING AND HE WAS DEEP INTO IT  BUILDING HIS FIRST COMMERCIAL WEB SITE WHILE STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL AND STARTING WORK ON THE POPULAR COMMUNITY SITE LIVEJOURNAL THE SUMMER BEFORE HE WENT TO COLLEGE   KEEPING UP WITH LIVEJOURNAL   S EVER GROWING POPULARITY FORCED FITZPATRICK TO LEARN THE HARD WAY ABOUT BUILDING SCALABLE WEB SITES AND ALONG THE WAY HE AND THE PROGRAMMERS AT THE COMPANY HE FOUNDED  DANGA INTERACTIVE  ENDED UP BUILDING SEVERAL PIECES OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE  INCLUDING MEMCACHED  PERLBAL  AND MOGILEFS  WHICH ARE NOW USED ON THE SERVERS OF MANY OF THE WORLD   S BUSIEST WEB SITES   FITZPATRICK IS A PROTOTYPICAL   IF EXCEPTIONALLY ACCOMPLISHED   TURN OF THE CENTURY WEB PROGRAMMER  HIS PRIMARY PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES HAVE BEEN PERL AND C  THOUGH HE ALSO WORKS IN JAVA  C    PYTHON  JAVASCRIPT  AND C  AS NEEDED  AND ALMOST ALL THE PROGRAMMING HE DOES IS SOMEHOW NETWORK RELATED  WHETHER IT   S BUILDING BETTER BACK END INFRASTRUCTURE FOR WEB SITES  DESIGNING PROTOCOLS AND SOFTWARE TO IMPROVE THE WAY BLOG READING SOFTWARE KNOWS WHEN BLOGS HAVE BEEN UPDATED  OR PROGRAMMING HIS CELL PHONE TO AUTOMATICALLY OPEN HIS GARAGE DOOR WHEN HE RIDES UP ON HIS MOTORCYCLE   WE TALKED ABOUT LEARNING TO PROGRAM AT THE SAME AGE AS HE WAS READING CLIFFORD THE BIG RED DOG  WHY HE WAS GLAD HE STAYED IN COLLEGE WHILE RUNNING LIVEJOURNAL  AND HOW HE LEARNED NOT TO BE AFRAID OF READING OTHER PEOPLE   S CODE   A SENIOR JAVASCRIPT ARCHITECT AT YAHOO   DOUGLAS CROCKFORD HAS BEEN A PROGRAMMER SINCE THE EARLY     0S WHEN HE TOOK A FORTRAN COURSE IN COLLEGE AFTER BEING UNABLE TO GET STUDIO TIME FOR HIS MAJOR IN TELEVISION BROADCASTING  OVER THE COURSE OF HIS CAREER  HE HAS COMBINED COMPUTERS WITH MEDIA IN VARIOUS WAYS AT PLACES LIKE ATARI  LUCASFILM  ELECTRIC COMMUNITIES  AND NOW YAHOO   CROCKFORD IS  BY NATURE  A SIMPLIFIER AND A TIDIER  HE INVENTED JSON  THE DATA INTERCHANGE FORMAT WIDELY USED IN AJAX APPLICATIONS  BECAUSE HE FOUND XML TOO COMPLICATED  HIS RECENTLY PUBLISHED BOOK  JAVASCRIPT  THE GOOD PARTS  ARGUES THAT JAVASCRIPT IS ACTUALLY QUITE A NICE LANGUAGE IF ONE AVOIDS CERTAIN FEATURES  WHEN I TALKED TO HIM HE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE OF SUBSETTING AS A WAY OF MANAGING COMPLEXITY AND DESCRIBED A CODE READING PROCESS HE USES THAT STARTS WITH SIMPLY TIDYING UP THE CODE   AT THE TIME OF OUR INTERVIEW  CROCKFORD HAD BECOME WELL KNOWN AS AN OUTSPOKEN CRITIC OF THE PROPOSED ECMASCRIPT    ES   REVISION TO THE ECMASCRIPT  JAVASCRIPT  LANGUAGE STANDARD  ON THE GROUNDS THAT IT WAS TOO COMPLEX  HE WAS IN FAVOR OF A MORE MODEST PROPOSAL LABELED ES     AND SINCE THEN HE AND THE OTHER ES    ADVOCATES HAVE LARGELY PREVAILED   ES    HAS BEEN RENAMED ES   AND THE ES  EFFORT HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY ABANDONED   CROCKFORD AND I TALKED ABOUT WHAT HE DISLIKED ABOUT THE ES  PROPOSAL  THE IMPORTANCE OF CODE READING AS A TEAM ACTIVITY  AND HOW TO MOVE THE WEB FORWARD DESPITE THE LEGACY OF EXISTING SYSTEMS    CREATOR OF JAVASCRIPT  PERHAPS THE MOST WIDELY USED AND MOST REVILED PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE ON THE MODERN WEB  BRENDAN EICH IS NOW CTO OF THE MOZILLA CORPORATION  THE SUBSIDIARY OF THE MOZILLA FOUNDATION RESPONSIBLE FOR CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT OF THE FIREFOX BROWSER   WITH AN APPRECIATION OF BOTH ELEGANT THEORY AND GOOD PRAGMATIC ENGINEERING  EICH SPENT THE EARLY DAYS OF HIS CAREER HACKING NETWORK AND KERNEL CODE AT SILICON GRAPHICS AND MICROUNITY  AFTER MICROUNITY  HE MOVED TO NETSCAPE  WHERE HE WORKED ON THE NETSCAPE BROWSER AND  UNDER INTENSE TIME PRESSURE  INVENTED JAVASCRIPT   IN       ALONG WITH JAMIE ZAWINSKI  HE WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE EFFORT TO CONVINCE NETSCAPE TO OPEN SOURCE ITS BROWSER  LEADING TO THE FORMATION OF MOZILLA ORG  WHERE HE WAS CHIEF ARCHITECT   IN RECENT YEARS EICH HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN BOTH HIGH LEVEL DIRECTION SETTING FOR THE MOZILLA PLATFORM AND IN LOW LEVEL HACKING ON A NEW JIT   ING JAVASCRIPT VIRTUAL MACHINE CALLED TRACEMONKEY  AND  AS HE EXPLAINS IN THIS INTERVIEW  HE HAS ALSO BEEN TRYING TO FIND WAYS FOR THE MOZILLA PROJECT TO    MOVE THE RESEARCH NEEDLE     BRINGING PRACTICAL MINDED ACADEMICS INTO THE MOZILLA FOLD IN ORDER TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN ACADEMIC THEORY AND INDUSTRIAL PRACTICE   OTHER TOPICS WE TOUCHED ON INCLUDE WHY JAVASCRIPT HAD TO LOOK SOMEWHAT LIKE JAVA BUT NOT TOO MUCH  WHY JAVASCRIPT DOES STILL NEED TO GROW AS A LANGUAGE DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE ECMASCRIPT   PROJECT  AND THE NEED FOR MORE KINDS OF STATIC CODE ANALYSIS   NOW CHIEF JAVA ARCHITECT AT GOOGLE  BLOCH PREVIOUSLY WAS A DISTINGUISHED ENGINEER AT SUN MICROSYSTEMS  WHERE HE LED THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE JAVA COLLECTIONS FRAMEWORK INTRODUCED IN JAVA   AND WAS INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN OF SEVERAL LANGUAGE ADDITIONS IN THE JAVA   RELEASE  HE HAS A BS FROM COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY AND A PHD FROM CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY  WHERE HE WORKED ON THE CAMELOT DISTRIBUTED TRANSACTION PROCESSING SYSTEM  WHICH LATER BECAME ENCINA  A PRODUCT OF TRANSARC  WHERE HE WAS A SENIOR SYSTEMS DESIGNER  HE WROTE THE  00  JOLT AWARD   WINNING BOOK EFFECTIVE JAVA AND COAUTHORED JAVA PUZZLERS AND JAVA CONCURRENCY IN PRACTICE   AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT FROM SOMEONE WHOSE JOB IS TO ENCOURAGE THE USE OF JAVA AT GOOGLE  BLOCH IS A STRONG ADVOCATE OF THE LANGUAGE  DESPITE THE RECENT FLURRY OF INTEREST IN APPROACHES TO CONCURRENCY SUCH AS SOFTWARE TRANSACTIONAL MEMORY OR ERLANG   S MESSAGE PASSING  BLOCH THINKS JAVA HAS    THE BEST APPROACH OF ANY LANGUAGE OUT THERE    TO CONCURRENCY AND PREDICTS A RESURGENCE OF INTEREST IN JAVA AS MORE AND MORE PROGRAMMERS ARE FORCED TO DEAL WITH PROGRAMMING FOR MACHINES WITH MULTICORE CPUS   BLOCH IS ALSO A STRONG ADVOCATE OF TREATING PROGRAMMING AS API DESIGN  AND WE TALKED ABOUT HOW THAT AFFECTS HIS OWN DESIGN PROCESS  AS WELL AS WHETHER JAVA HAS GOTTEN TOO COMPLEX AND WHY PICKING A PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE IS LIKE PICKING A BAR   JOE ARMSTRONG IS BEST KNOWN AS THE CREATOR OF THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE ERLANG AND THE OPEN TELECOM PLATFORM  OTP   A FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDING ERLANG APPLICATIONS   IN THE MODERN LANGUAGE LANDSCAPE  ERLANG IS A BIT OF AN ODD DUCK  IT IS BOTH OLDER AND YOUNGER THAN MANY POPULAR LANGUAGES  ARMSTRONG STARTED WORK ON IT IN        A YEAR BEFORE PERL APPEARED   BUT IT WAS AVAILABLE ONLY AS A COMMERCIAL PRODUCT AND USED PRIMARILY WITHIN ERICSSON UNTIL IT WAS RELEASED AS OPEN SOURCE IN       THREE YEARS AFTER JAVA AND RUBY APPEARED  ITS ROOTS ARE IN THE LOGIC PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE PROLOG RATHER THAN SOME MEMBER OF THE ALGOL FAMILY  AND IT WAS DESIGNED FOR A FAIRLY SPECIFIC KIND OF SOFTWARE  HIGHLY AVAILABLE  HIGHLY RELIABLE SYSTEMS LIKE TELEPHONE SWITCHES   BUT THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT MADE IT GOOD FOR BUILDING TELEPHONE SWITCHES ALSO   AND ALMOST INADVERTENTLY   MADE IT QUITE WELL SUITED TO WRITING CONCURRENT SOFTWARE  SOMETHING WHICH HAS DRAWN NOTICE AS PROGRAMMERS HAVE STARTED WRESTLING WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE MULTICORE FUTURE   ARMSTRONG  TOO  IS A BIT OF AN ODD DUCK  ORIGINALLY A PHYSICIST  HE SWITCHED TO COMPUTER SCIENCE WHEN HE RAN OUT OF MONEY IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS PHYSICS PHD AND LANDED A JOB AS A RESEARCHER WORKING FOR DONALD MICHIE   ONE OF THE FOUNDERS OF THE FIELD OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN BRITAIN  AT MICHIE   S LAB  ARMSTRONG WAS EXPOSED TO THE FULL RANGE OF AI GOODIES  BECOMING A FOUNDING MEMBER OF THE BRITISH ROBOTICS ASSOCIATION AND WRITING PAPERS ABOUT ROBOTIC VISION   WHEN FUNDING FOR AI DRIED UP AS A RESULT OF THE FAMOUS LIGHTHILL  IT WAS BACK TO PHYSICS RELATED PROGRAMMING FOR MORE THAN HALF A DECADE  FIRST AT THE EISCAT SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATION AND LATER THE SWEDISH SPACE CORPORATION  BEFORE FINALLY JOINING THE ERICSSON COMPUTER SCIENCE LAB  WHERE HE INVENTED ERLANG   IN OUR SEVERAL DAYS OF CONVERSATION OVER HIS KITCHEN TABLE IN STOCKHOLM  WE TALKED ABOUT  AMONG OTHER THINGS  THE ERLANG APPROACH TO CONCURRENCY  THE NEED FOR BETTER AND SIMPLER WAYS OF CONNECTING PROGRAMS  AND THE IMPORTANCE OF OPENING UP BLACK BOXES    ONE OF THE INSTIGATORS  BACK IN       OF THE PROJECT THAT LED TO THE DEFINITION OF THE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE HASKELL  SIMON PEYTON JONES IS A PRINCIPAL RESEARCHER AT MICROSOFT RESEARCH   S LAB IN CAMBRIDGE  ENGLAND  HE EDITED THE HASKELL    REVISED REPORT  THE CURRENT STABLE DEFINITION OF THE LANGUAGE  HE IS THE ARCHITECT AND LEAD DEVELOPER OF THE GLASGOW HASKELL COMPILER  GHC   THE    DE FACTO STANDARD COMPILER    ACCORDING TO HASKELL ORG  AND HE GAVE HASKELL ITS WIDELY CITED UNOFFICIAL MOTTO     AVOID SUCCESS AT ALL COSTS      A HIGH POWERED RESEARCHER AND FORMER PROFESSOR WHO NEVER GOT A PHD  PEYTON JONES VALUES BOTH THE PRACTICAL AND THE THEORETICALLY BEAUTIFUL  HE LEARNED TO PROGRAM ON A MACHINE WITH NO PERMANENT STORAGE AND ONLY  00 MEMORY LOCATIONS  AND IN COLLEGE HE WORKED ON BOTH WRITING HIGH LEVEL COMPILERS FOR THE SCHOOL   S BIG IRON AND BUILDING HIS OWN PRIMITIVE COMPUTERS OUT OF PARTS HE COULD AFFORD ON A STUDENT   S BUDGET  BUT HE WAS DRAWN TO FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING BY A PROFESSOR   S DEMONSTRATION OF HOW TO BUILD DOUBLY LINKED LISTS WITHOUT USING MUTATION AND THE BEAUTY OF THE IDEA OF LAZY EVALUATION  PEYTON JONES SAW THE IDEAS OF FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING    AS A RADICAL AND ELEGANT ATTACK ON THE WHOLE ENTERPRISE OF WRITING PROGRAMS     A WAY  RATHER THAN    JUST PUTTING ONE MORE BRICK IN THE WALL     TO    BUILD A WHOLE NEW WALL     IN  00  THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY ELECTED HIM A FELLOW  CITING HIS    CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES      AMONG THE TOPICS WE COVERED IN THIS INTERVIEW ARE WHY HE THINKS FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING SHOWS INCREASING PROMISE OF CHANGING THE WAY SOFTWARE IS WRITTEN  WHY SOFTWARE TRANSACTIONAL MEMORY IS A MUCH BETTER WAY OF WRITING CONCURRENT SOFTWARE THAN LOCKS AND CONDITION VARIABLES  AND WHY IT IS SO DIFFICULT  EVEN AT A PLACE LIKE MICROSOFT RESEARCH  TO DO REAL STUDIES OF WHETHER DIFFERENT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES MAKE PROGRAMMERS MORE OR LESS PRODUCTIVE   PETER NORVIG IS A BROAD THINKER AND A HACKER AT HEART  HE ONCE WROTE A PROGRAM TO FIND IN GOOGLE   S SEARCH LOGS SERIES OF THREE CONSECUTIVE SEARCHES BY THE SAME USER THAT  WHEN PUT TOGETHER  MADE A HAIKU  ONE OF THE MOST MEMORABLE     JAVA ECC   JAVA ELLIPTICAL CURVE   PLAYBOY FAQ       ON HIS WEB SITE NORVIG HAS LINKS TO THE USUAL STUFF  BOOKS AND PAPERS HE   S WRITTEN  SLIDES FROM TALKS HE   S GIVEN  AND VARIOUS BITS OF HIS CODE  BUT THERE ARE ALSO LINKS TO ITEMS HE   S HAD PUBLISHED IN MCSWEENEY   S QUARTERLY CONCERN  HIS WITTY RECOUNTING OF WRITING A PROGRAM TO GENERATE THE WORLD   S LONGEST PALINDROMIC SENTENCE  AND HIS    GETTYSBURG POWERPOINT PRESENTATION     A SEND UP OF MICROSOFT   S POWERPOINT SOFTWARE  WHICH HAS BEEN CITED BY EDWARD TUFTE AND WHICH APPEARS ON THE FIRST PAGE OF RESULTS IF YOU GOOGLE    POWERPOINT      HE IS NOW THE DIRECTOR OF RESEARCH AT GOOGLE  AFTER HAVING BEEN THE DIRECTOR OF SEARCH QUALITY  PRIOR TO THAT HE HAD BEEN THE HEAD OF THE COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCES DIVISION AT NASA AMES RESEARCH CENTER AND BEFORE THAT  AN EARLY EMPLOYEE AT THE LATE     0S INTERNET STARTUP JUNGLEE  HE WON THE NASA EXCEPTIONAL ACHIEVEMENT AWARD IN  00  AND IS A FELLOW OF THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY   BETWEEN GOOGLE  NASA  AND JUNGLEE  NORVIG HAS EXPERIENCE WITH BOTH THE    HACKER    AND    ENGINEER    APPROACHES TO BUILDING SOFTWARE AND TALKS IN THIS INTERVIEW ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF EACH  AS A FORMER COMPUTER SCIENCE PROFESSOR AND NOW AN INSIDER AT ONE OF THE BIGGEST INDUSTRIAL SOFTWARE SHOPS IN THE WORLD  HE ALSO HAS AN INTERESTING PERSPECTIVE ON THE RELATION BETWEEN ACADEMIC COMPUTER SCIENCE AND INDUSTRIAL PRACTICE   OTHER TOPICS IN OUR CONVERSATION INCLUDED HOW PROGRAMMING HAS CHANGED IN RECENT YEARS  WHY NO DESIGN TECHNIQUE CAN MAKE UP FOR NOT KNOWING WHAT YOU   RE DOING  AND WHY NASA MIGHT BE BETTER OFF WITH LESS RELIABLE BUT CHEAPER SOFTWARE   IF ALAN KAY IS SMALLTALK   S FATHER  DAN INGALLS IS ITS MOTHER   SMALLTALK MAY HAVE STARTED AS A GLEAM IN ALAN KAY   S EYE  BUT INGALLS IS THE ONE WHO DID THE HARD WORK OF BRINGING IT INTO THE WORLD  STARTING WITH THE FIRST IMPLEMENTATION OF SMALLTALK  WRITTEN IN BASIC AND BASED ON ONE PAGE OF NOTES FROM KAY  INGALLS HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN IMPLEMENTING SEVEN GENERATIONS OF SMALLTALK FROM THE FIRST PROTOTYPE TO THE PRESENT DAY OPEN SOURCE IMPLEMENTATION  SQUEAK   ORIGINALLY A PHYSICIST  INGALLS STARTED PROGRAMMING WITH FORTRAN  MADE A BUSINESS SELLING A PROFILER HE WROTE WHILE IN GRAD SCHOOL  AND EVENTUALLY FOUND HIS WAY TO XEROX PARC  WHERE HE JOINED KAY   S LEARNING RESEARCH GROUP  WHICH BUILT SMALLTALK AND EXPLORED THE USE OF COMPUTERS IN CHILDREN   S EDUCATION   WHILE AT PARC  INGALLS ALSO INVENTED THE BITBLT OPERATION USED IN BIT MAPPED GRAPHICS AND CODED IT IN MICROCODE FOR PARC   S ALTO COMPUTER  ALLOWING THE HIGH PERFORMANCE BIT MAPPED GRAPHICS THAT ENABLED UI INNOVATIONS SUCH AS POP UP MENUS THAT WE NOW ALL TAKE FOR GRANTED   AT ONE OF INGALLS   S IN HOUSE DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE SMALLTALK SYSTEM  A POP UP MENU CAUSED THE SUBJECT OF MY NEXT CHAPTER  L PETER DEUTSCH  TO LEAP TO HIS FEET AND EXCLAIM     DID YOU JUST DO WHAT I THOUGHT YOU DID       NOW A DISTINGUISHED ENGINEER AT SUN MICROSYSTEMS  INGALLS IS WORKING ON LIVELY KERNEL  A SMALLTALK LIKE PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT THAT RUNS COMPLETELY IN THE BROWSER USING JAVASCRIPT AND BROWSER PROVIDED GRAPHICS  HE RECEIVED THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY GRACE MURRAY HOPPER AWARD IN      AND THE ACM SOFTWARE SYSTEM AWARD IN      FOR HIS WORK ON SMALLTALK  IN  00  HE WON THE DR  DOBB   S EXCELLENCE IN PROGRAMMING AWARD   IN OUR CONVERSATION  WE TALKED ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERACTIVE PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENTS  WHY IT WAS A LUCKY THING HE NEVER LEARNED LISP  AND WHY IT   S BETTER TO BUILD FLEXIBLE  DYNAMIC SYSTEMS AND THEN LOCK THEM DOWN RATHER THAN BUILDING STATIC SYSTEMS AND THEN TRYING TO ADD DYNAMIC FEATURES   A PRODIGY  L PETER DEUTSCH STARTED PROGRAMMING IN THE LATE     0S  AT AGE     WHEN HIS FATHER BROUGHT HOME A MEMO ABOUT THE PROGRAMMING OF DESIGN CALCULATIONS FOR THE CAMBRIDGE ELECTRON ACCELERATOR AT HARVARD  HE WAS SOON HANGING OUT AT MIT  IMPLEMENTING LISP ON A PDP    AND HACKING ON AND IMPROVING CODE WRITTEN BY MIT HACKERS NEARLY TWICE HIS AGE   AS A SOPHOMORE AT UC BERKELEY  HE GOT INVOLVED WITH PROJECT GENIE  ONE OF THE FIRST MINICOMPUTER BASED TIMESHARING SYSTEMS  WRITING MOST OF THE OPERATING SYSTEM   S KERNEL   KEN THOMPSON  INVENTOR OF UNIX AND THE SUBJECT OF CHAPTER     WOULD ALSO WORK ON THE PROJECT WHILE A GRAD STUDENT AT BERKELEY  INFLUENCING HIS LATER WORK ON UNIX   AFTER PARTICIPATING IN A FAILED ATTEMPT TO COMMERCIALIZE THE PROJECT GENIE SYSTEM  DEUTSCH MOVED TO XEROX PARC  WHERE HE WORKED ON THE INTERLISP SYSTEM AND ON THE SMALLTALK VIRTUAL MACHINE  HELPING TO INVENT THE TECHNIQUE OF JUST IN TIME COMPILATION   HE SERVED AS CHIEF SCIENTIST AT THE PARC SPIN OFF  PARCPLACE  AND WAS A FELLOW AT SUN MICROSYSTEMS  WHERE HE PUT TO PAPER THE NOW FAMOUS    SEVEN FALLACIES OF DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING     HE IS ALSO THE AUTHOR OF GHOSTSCRIPT  THE POSTSCRIPT VIEWER  IN       HE WAS PART OF THE GROUP THAT RECEIVED THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY SOFTWARE SYSTEM AWARD  FOR THEIR WORK ON INTERLISP  AND IN      HE WAS ELECTED A FELLOW OF THE ACM   IN  00  DEUTSCH QUIT WORK ON GHOSTSCRIPT IN ORDER TO STUDY MUSICAL COMPOSITION  TODAY HE IS MORE LIKELY TO BE WORKING ON A NEW MUSICAL COMPOSITION THAN ON A NEW PROGRAM  BUT STILL CAN   T RESIST THE URGE TO HACK EVERY NOW AND THEN  MOSTLY ON A MUSICAL SCORE EDITOR OF HIS OWN DEVISING   AMONG THE TOPICS WE COVERED IN OUR CONVERSATION WERE THE DEEP PROBLEMS HE SEES WITH ANY COMPUTER LANGUAGE THAT INCLUDES THE NOTION OF A POINTER OR A REFERENCE  WHY SOFTWARE SHOULD BE TREATED AS A CAPITAL ASSET RATHER THAN AN EXPENSE  AND WHY HE ULTIMATELY RETIRED FROM PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMMING    KEN THOMPSON IS THE ORIGINAL BEARDED UNIX HACKER  HE HAS SPENT A CAREER WORKING ON WHATEVER HE FINDS INTERESTING  WHICH HAS  AT VARIOUS TIMES  INCLUDED ANALOG COMPUTING  SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING  REGULAR EXPRESSIONS  AND COMPUTER CHESS   HIRED AS A RESEARCHER AT BELL LABS TO WORK ON THE MULTICS PROJECT  AFTER BELL LABS PULLED OUT OF MULTICS  THOMPSON WENT ON  WITH DENNIS RITCHIE  TO INVENT UNIX  AN ENDEAVOR FOR WHICH HE FULLY EXPECTED TO BE FIRED  HE ALSO INVENTED THE B PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE  THE PRECURSOR TO DENNIS RITCHIE   S C   LATER HE GOT INTERESTED IN COMPUTER CHESS  BUILDING BELLE  THE FIRST SPECIAL PURPOSE CHESS COMPUTER AND THE STRONGEST COMPUTERIZED CHESS PLAYER OF ITS TIME  HE ALSO HELPED EXPAND CHESS ENDGAME TABLEBASES TO COVER ALL FOUR  AND FIVE PIECE ENDGAMES   WHEN WORKING ON BELL LABS    PLAN   OPERATING SYSTEM  HE DEVISED THE NOW UBIQUITOUS UTF   UNICODE ENCODING   IN       THOMPSON AND RITCHIE RECEIVED THE TURING AWARD FOR THEIR    DEVELOPMENT OF GENERIC OPERATING SYSTEMS THEORY AND SPECIFICALLY FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM     HE WAS ALSO AWARDED THE NATIONAL MEDAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE INSTITUTE OF ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS TSUTOMU KANAI AWARD  BOTH FOR HIS WORK ON UNIX   IN THIS INTERVIEW HE TALKED ABOUT HIS EARLY LOVE OF ELECTRONICS  A RATHER UNORTHODOX ACADEMIC CAREER THAT HAD HIM TEACHING COURSES WHILE HE WAS STILL A STUDENT  AND WHY MODERN PROGRAMMING SCARES HIM    PLANNING TO BE A MATH TEACHER BUT NEEDING TO PAY OFF HER STUDENT LOANS  IN      FRAN ALLEN TOOK WHAT SHE INTENDED TO BE A TEMPORARY JOB AS A PROGRAMMER AT IBM RESEARCH  HER FIRST ASSIGNMENT  TEACH RESISTIVE IBM SCIENTISTS THE NEWLY INVENTED LANGUAGE FORTRAN   INSTEAD OF RETURNING TO TEACHING  ALLEN STAYED AT IBM FOR    YEARS AND WORKED ON A SERIES OF COMPILER PROJECTS  INCLUDING THE COMPILERS FOR THE STRETCH HARVEST MACHINE AND THE AMBITIOUS BUT NEVER BUILT ACS   SUPERCOMPUTER AS WELL AS HER OWN PTRAN PROJECT  WHICH DEVELOPED TECHNIQUES FOR AUTOMATIC PARALLELIZATION OF FORTRAN PROGRAMS AND DEVELOPED THE STATIC SINGLE ASSIGNMENT INTERMEDIATE REPRESENTATION  WHICH IS NOW WIDELY USED IN BOTH STATIC AND JUST IN TIME COMPILERS   IN  00  ALLEN WAS AWARDED THE TURING AWARD FOR HER    PIONEERING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF OPTIMIZING COMPILER TECHNIQUES     BECOMING THE FIRST FEMALE RECIPIENT IN THE  0 YEAR HISTORY OF THE PRIZE  SHE WAS ALSO THE FIRST WOMAN TO BE NAMED AN IBM FELLOW  IBM   S TOP TECHNICAL HONOR  SHE IS ALSO A FELLOW OF THE IEEE AND THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY AND A MEMBER OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF ENGINEERING  THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF ARTS AND SCIENCES  AND THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY   OVER HER CAREER  ALLEN HAS OBSERVED THE CHANGING ROLE OF WOMEN IN COMPUTING  FROM HER EARLIEST DAYS WHEN WOMEN WERE SPECIFICALLY RECRUITED BY COMPANIES LIKE IBM FOR THE NEW AND ILL DEFINED JOB OF    PROGRAMMER     TO LATER DECADES WHEN THE FIELD BECAME LARGELY MALE DOMINATED   IN OUR CONVERSATION SHE TALKS ABOUT WHAT THAT TRANSITION WAS LIKE AS WELL AS WHY IT IS IMPORTANT TO INCREASE THE DIVERSITY IN THE FIELD AND HOW C HAS GRIEVOUSLY WOUNDED THE STUDY OF COMPUTER SCIENCE    IN      WHEN THE FIRST TWO NODES OF THE ARPANET   THE NETWORK THAT WOULD BECOME THE CORE OF THE INTERNET   CAME ON LINE  EVERY PACKET THAT FLOWED OVER  0 KILOBIT SECOND LEASED LINES WAS ROUTED THROUGH TWO SPECIALIZED COMPUTERS CALLED INTERFACE MESSAGE PROCESSORS  OR IMPS  THE IMPS WERE DESIGNED AND BUILT BY BOLT BERANEK AND NEWMAN  BBN   AND THE SOFTWARE THAT RAN THE IMPS HAD BEEN WRITTEN BY A TEAM OF THREE PROGRAMMERS  ONE OF WHOM WAS BERNIE COSELL  WHO HAD LEFT MIT THREE YEARS BEFORE  AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS JUNIOR YEAR  TO JOIN BBN   ORIGINALLY HIRED AS AN APPLICATION PROGRAMMER ON A PROJECT BUILDING ONE OF THE EARLIEST TIMESHARING SYSTEMS  COSELL QUICKLY MOVED TO THE SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING SIDE OF THINGS AND WAS SOON    CZAR OF THE PDP   TIMESHARING SYSTEM    RESPONSIBLE FOR FINISHING THE OPERATING SYSTEM CODE AND KEEPING THE SYSTEM RUNNING   OVER A    YEAR CAREER AT BBN  COSELL WOULD WORK ON A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING  EARNING A REPUTATION WITHIN BBN AS A MASTER DEBUGGER AND    FIXER    WHO COULD BE THROWN ONTO A STRUGGLING PROJECT TO MAKE THE SOFTWARE WORK  AND HE HACKED JUST FOR FUN  TO HONE HIS LISP SKILLS HE WROTE DOCTOR  A VERSION OF JOSEPH WEIZENBAUM   S ELIZA  BASED ON WEIZENBAUM   S DESCRIPTION IN A JOURNAL ARTICLE  WRITTEN IN BBN LISP  WHICH SPREAD AROUND THE ARPANET ALONG WITH THE TENEX OPERATING SYSTEM  COSELL   S VERSION OF DOCTOR ALSO HAD A WIDE DISTRIBUTION   WIDER THAN WEIZENBAUM   S ORIGINAL   INSPIRING NEW IMPLEMENTATIONS AND RELATED PROGRAMS   IN      COSELL LEFT BBN AND BOUGHT A SHEEP FARM IN VIRGINIA  WHERE HE NOW LIVES WITH HIS WIFE LYNN  THREE DOGS  INNUMERABLE CATS  AND LOTS OF SHEEP  HE DOES SOME PROGRAMMING FOR A LOCAL ISP  HACKS A BIT ON HIS OWN PROJECTS  AND TEACHES A FEW COURSES IN PROGRAMMING AND COMPUTER SECURITY BUT IS GLAD HE NO LONGER WORKS AS A FULL TIME PROGRAMMER  IRONICALLY  AS A RESULT OF HIS MOVE TO THE COUNTRY  COSELL   ONE OF THE FATHERS OF THE INTERNET   NOW HAS ONLY DIAL UP ACCESS FROM HIS HOME   IN THIS INTERVIEW WE TALKED ABOUT HOW HE WON HIS REPUTATION AS A MASTER DEBUGGER  THE IMPORTANCE OF WRITING CLEAR CODE  AND HOW HE CONVINCED THE OTHER PROGRAMMERS ON THE IMP PROJECT TO STOP PATCHING THE BINARY    OF ALL THE SUBJECTS OF THIS BOOK  DONALD KNUTH PERHAPS LEAST NEEDS AN INTRODUCTION  FOR THE PAST FOUR DECADES HE HAS BEEN AT WORK ON HIS MULTIVOLUME MASTERWORK THE ART OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING  THE BIBLE OF FUNDAMENTAL ALGORITHMS AND DATA STRUCTURES  WHICH AMERICAN SCIENTIST INCLUDED ON ITS LIST OF THE TOP    PHYSICAL SCIENCES MONOGRAPHS OF THE CENTURY  IN THE COMPANY OF WORKS BY RUSSELL AND WHITEHEAD  EINSTEIN  DIRAC  FEYNMAN  AND VON NEUMANN  HE POPULARIZED THE USE OF ASYMPTOTIC  A K A  BIG O  NOTATION IN ANALYZING ALGORITHMS  INVENTED LR PARSING  AND DEFENDED GOTO STATEMENTS FROM DIJKSTRA   S CRITICISM   BUT HE IS NOT SIMPLY A THEORIST  AFTER FINISHING VOLUME III OF THE ART OF COMPUTER PROGRAMMING IN       KNUTH TOOK WHAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A YEAR OFF TO WRITE THE TYPESETTING SOFTWARE TEX AND METAFONT SO HE COULD SEE HIS BOOKS TYPESET TO HIS OWN SATISFACTION  TEN YEARS LATER HE WAS DONE  HAVING ALONG THE WAY INVENTED A NEW STYLE OF PROGRAMMING     LITERATE PROGRAMMING     AND AN ALGORITHM FOR BREAKING PARAGRAPHS OF TEXT INTO LINES FOR TYPESETTING THAT IS STILL PRETTY MUCH THE STATE OF THE ART   HIS NUMEROUS AWARDS HAVE INCLUDED THE FIRST ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTING MACHINERY GRACE MURRAY HOPPER AWARD         THE TURING AWARD         AND THE NATIONAL MEDAL OF SCIENCE         IN    0 HE STOPPED USING EMAIL  EXPLAINING THAT HIS JOB WAS NOT    TO BE ON TOP OF THINGS    BUT    TO BE ON THE BOTTOM OF THINGS    DEEPLY UNDERSTANDING AND EXPLAINING LARGE AREAS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE SO HE COULD EXPLAIN THEM IN HIS BOOKS   IN THIS INTERVIEW WE TALKED ABOUT KNUTH   S ENTHUSIASM FOR LITERATE PROGRAMMING  HIS AMBIVALENCE ABOUT BLACK BOXES  AND WHAT HE SEES AS A REGRETTABLE    OVEREMPHASIS ON REUSABLE SOFTWARE      LEBRON WILL FINALLY BRING THE CAVS A CHAMPIONSHIP
